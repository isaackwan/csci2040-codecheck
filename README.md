# CSCI2040 LabCheck
This is an in-browser solution checker for your [CSCI2040](http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~cslui/csci2040.html) exercises.

## How?
Beneath the surface is [Brython](brython.info) or Browser-Python. It is an JS implementation of Python 3. The `unittest` module is used for the tests

## Status: unmaintained
Because of growing difficulties of writing tests (e.g. CLI scripts in lab 4), I am no longer maintaining this project. If you are interested, please feel free to take over the project.
